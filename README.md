# Hurricane Client

This is just another custom client you can use to play the wonderful game,
Haven & Hearth. This client is built on top of the "Vanilla" Client, and
does not depend on any other custom clients.
I try to merge all of the code changes that are done to the base client
by Loftar, and I try to keep it up to date, to avoid crashes.

This client can be played standalone, or through Steam, by subscribing to
the Steam Workshop item.

## Downloading/Updating the Hurricane Client (Outside of Steam):
Use the Primitive Updater: https://github.com/Nightdawg/Hurricane/releases/tag/updater 

 --- OR ---

Manually download the latest release: https://github.com/Nightdawg/Hurricane/releases/latest

### If the updater doesn't work:
1. Make sure your installed Java version is between 15 and 21.
2. You might need to add the updater file (HurricaneUpdater.bat) to your anti-virus exceptions list.

## Launching the Hurricane Client (Outside of Steam):

Run the Play.bat file inside the client folder.

The client works with any java version between Java 15 - Java 21    
I've also been playing on GraalVM 21 (some different open-source java distribution based on OpenJDK),
and I seem to get like 15-20 extra FPS out of the client.

### If the client doesn't launch:
1. Make sure your installed Java version is between 15 and 21.
2. You might need to add the launcher file (Play.bat) to your anti-virus exceptions list.


## This client also supports Cediner's Web Map server (you set up your own private map server, it's not a public map):
